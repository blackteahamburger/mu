Roadmap (Mappa MUndi)
---------------------

(Apologies for the pun: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mappa_mundi)

Mu started as a shonky hack. Now many people are interested in our small editor
for educational use and we owe it to them to be clear what our plans are, how
we work together and how *anyone* can get involved (see ``CONTRIBUTING.rst``).

I believe it worth repeating the Mu philosophy we have followed so far:

* Less is More: Mu has only the most essential features, so users are not
  intimidated by a baffling interface.
* Path of Least Resistance: Whatever the task, there is always only one obvious
  way to do it with Mu.
* Keep it Simple: It's quick and easy to learn Mu ~ complexity impedes a novice
  programmer's first steps.
* Have fun: Learning should inspire fun ~ Mu helps learners quickly create and
  test working code.

Python aims to make code readable, Mu aims to make it writeable.

With this in mind:

Next Minor Release
==================

1.3.0 will include:

* Realtime generation of API documentation used by Mu's autocomplete and call tip functionality.
* Updates to the user interface for a more user-friendly experience.

Expected delivery: uncertain (even never)
